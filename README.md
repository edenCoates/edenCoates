### Hello!
I'm Eden Coates, a recent college graduate, and I'm interested in becoming a professional dev. <br />
In my couple years of experience, my favorite languages to write in are C++ and C, but I've written in Python and Java as well (and enjoyed them). <br />
Currently, this page houses school projects from college, since my personal projects aren't quite at the level where they can be put up here. <br />
But stay tuned! If you have any questions, feel free to email me at eden.coates@gmail.com <br />
