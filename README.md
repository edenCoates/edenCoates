### Hello!

I'm Eden Coates, a recent college graduate, and I'm interested in becoming a programmer.

My favorite languages to write in are C++ and C, but I've written in Python and Java as well (and enjoyed them).

Currently, this page houses school projects from college, since my personal projects aren't quite at the level where they an be put up here.

But stay tuned! If you have any questions, feel free to email me at eden.coates@gmail.com
