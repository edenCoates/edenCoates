### Hello!
I'm Eden Coates, a recent college graduate, and I'm interested in becoming a professional dev. <br />
In my couple years of experience, my favorite language to write in is C++/C, but I've written in Python and Java as well (and enjoyed them). <br />
Currently, this page mostly houses projects from my college programming courses; in the future, it'll also hold my personal projects, but they're not quite at the level where they can be put onto Github. But stay tuned! <br />
If you have any questions, feel free to email me at eden.coates@gmail.com. <br />
